# PS5 Relapse self-host

Package a home-server DNS + HTTPS host for the **PS5 Relapse** exploit chain (firmware **7.00–13.60**), so the console’s **User’s Guide** loads your page instead of Sony’s manual.

This repository **does not** vendor exploit code, payloads, certificates, or keys. It clones an upstream host page at setup time and applies a small overlay that matches a known-good working page.

Upstream projects:

- [ntfargo/Relapse-Exploit](https://github.com/ntfargo/Relapse-Exploit) — exploit chain
- [arg0WAK/WAK1360-Relapse](https://github.com/arg0WAK/WAK1360-Relapse) — UI host page (default clone target, pinned commit)
- [ps5-payload-dev/ftpsrv](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/ftpsrv) — optional FTP payload (`ftpsrv-ps5.elf`)

> **Disclaimer.** Educational / security-research use on devices you own. Jailbreaking can brick hardware, void warranties, and violate terms of service. You assume the risk.

## How it works

```
PS5 ──DNS──► dnsmasq on your server
               │
               ├─ manuals.playstation.net  →  SERVER_IP
               ├─ manual.playstation.net   →  SERVER_IP
               ├─ doc.dl.playstation.net   →  SERVER_IP
               └─ update / patch hosts     →  0.0.0.0  (blocked)

PS5 opens User’s Guide (HTTPS)
  → nginx on SERVER_IP:443 serves the host page
  → START runs the exploit → PAYLOADS (OnionHEN, ShadowMount+, FTP, …)
```

1. **dnsmasq** answers authoritative A records for the User’s Guide hostnames and black-holes Sony update domains so the console stays on its current firmware.
2. **nginx** serves the host page on **80 and 443** with a self-signed cert for `manuals.playstation.net`.
3. An **overlay** on top of pinned WAK1360 makes the page survive deep User’s Guide paths, aggressive caching, and UA quirks.

---

## Requirements

- Linux host with Docker + Compose v2 (dnsmasq uses `network_mode: host`)
- Free **UDP/TCP 53**, **TCP 80**, **TCP 443** on that host
- Ability to set the PS5’s DNS (and ideally your LAN DHCP DNS) to `SERVER_IP`
- `git`, `python3`, `openssl`, `curl` (or `wget`)

macOS / Docker Desktop can build and validate configs, but host-network DNS will not behave the same; run the stack on a Linux box on your LAN.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThatRetiredDude/ps5-relapse-selfhost.git
cd ps5-relapse-selfhost

cp .env.example .env
# edit .env → set SERVER_IP to this machine’s LAN IPv4

./scripts/render-config.sh   # dnsmasq.conf + nginx/default.conf
./scripts/generate-cert.sh   # certs/manuals.{crt,key}
./scripts/setup-host.sh      # clone pinned WAK1360 → www/ + apply overlay
./scripts/add-ftpsrv.sh      # optional: official ftpsrv-ps5.elf + payloads.json entry

docker compose up -d
./scripts/verify.sh
```

### Point DNS at the server

**Option A — PS5 only**

Settings → Network → Set Up Internet Connection → Custom → DNS  
Primary = `SERVER_IP`, Secondary = e.g. `1.1.1.1`

**Option B — whole LAN (recommended)**  
Set your router’s DHCP DNS to `SERVER_IP` so every device (including the PS5) uses dnsmasq. Upstream resolvers in `.env` handle everything that isn’t overridden.

### On the PS5

1. Confirm firmware is in the supported range (7.00–13.60) and stays there (update hosts are blocked).
2. Open **User’s Guide** (the book icon). You should see the Relapse / WAK host page, not Sony’s manual.
3. Press **START**. After a successful run, use **PAYLOADS** (OnionHEN, ShadowMount+, FTP, ProsperoStore, etc.).

## Overlay (what `setup-host.sh` applies)

Default `HOST_REF` pins [WAK1360-Relapse](https://github.com/arg0WAK/WAK1360-Relapse) at commit `b2398fd5bea116f990595e0a187ae94d8c6db43d`. Files under `overlay/` are copied on top:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `overlay/index.html` | `<base href="/">`, `?v=4` cache-bust on **all** scripts, includes `force-ready.js` |
| `overlay/src/firmware.js` | More tolerant UA / firmware detection + clearer rejection text |
| `overlay/src/helper.js` | Logs UA; shows the real rejection string when incompatible |
| `overlay/src/force-ready.js` | Marks the UI READY when the UA looks like a PlayStation |

`overlay/payloads.json` (with the FTP Server entry) is applied by `scripts/add-ftpsrv.sh`, not by `setup-host.sh`.

---

## Optional: FTP payload

```bash
./scripts/add-ftpsrv.sh
```

Downloads [`ftpsrv-ps5.elf`](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/ftpsrv/releases/download/v0.21.1/ftpsrv-ps5.elf) from the official [ps5-payload-dev/ftpsrv](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/ftpsrv) **v0.21.1** release, verifies SHA-256 `7d4b31c8…`, installs it into `www/payloads/`, and writes `payloads.json` with the FTP Server entry (port **2121**). The ELF is **never** committed to this repo.

If the release URL is unreachable, download that asset by hand into `www/payloads/ftpsrv-ps5.elf` and copy `overlay/payloads.json` over `www/payloads/payloads.json`.

---

## The gotchas (why this package exists)

### 1. HTTPS on port 443

The User’s Guide loads over **HTTPS**. Serving only port 80 is not enough.

### 2. SPA fallback silently kills `firmware.js`

If nginx falls back to `index.html` for missing `.js` files, a bad path returns HTML with HTTP 200 and the exploit dies silently. This package makes `.js` / `.css` return a real **404**.

### 3. Deep User’s Guide paths are handled on the server

The Guide opens URLs like `/document/en/ps5/…`. nginx rewrites nested `/src/` and `/assets/` requests back to the site root, and `try_files` serves `index.html` for the deep HTML path. The overlay still includes `<base href="/">` as an optional client-side backup.

### 4. The PS5 browser caches aggressively

nginx sends `Cache-Control: no-store`, and the overlay uses `?v=4` on script tags.

### 5. ShadowMount+ only scans when it starts

Re-run ShadowMount+ from PAYLOADS after installing new titles.

### 6. Autoload ShadowMount+ and FTP

Configure autoload in `payloads.json` (order = injection priority). See upstream docs.

### 7. OnionHEN + homebrew title IDs

Homebrew may need a correct `param.json` and an OnionHEN config entry, or you get a generic error dialog.

### 8. Plain HTTP containers on a side port are not enough

Publishing the same files on an alternate HTTP port (for example **:8765**) without the SPA `try_files` fallback will **404** on `/document/en/ps5/`. The PS5 User’s Guide talks to **HTTPS :443** on `manuals.playstation.net`. Use the compose `web` service or the Unraid host-nginx drop-in below — not a stock nginx on a random port.

## Optional: Unraid / existing host nginx

If your NAS already runs nginx on 80/443:

1. Still run the **dns** service from this compose file (or any dnsmasq with the same records).
2. Skip compose `web`, or leave it unpublished.
3. Render and merge the drop-in:

```bash
export SERVER_IP=192.168.1.50
export WAK_ROOT=/path/to/ps5-relapse-selfhost/www
export CERT_DIR=/path/to/ps5-relapse-selfhost/certs
# optional overrides:
# export DROP_IN=/boot/config/custom/relapse-nginx.conf
# export NGINX_SERVERS_CONF=/etc/nginx/conf.d/servers.conf
./unraid/apply-nginx.sh
```

Keep the `.js`/`.css` `=404` rule and `Cache-Control: no-store`. Re-run the apply script after reboot if your host nginx config is regenerated from drop-ins.

---

## Updating the host page

```bash
./scripts/setup-host.sh        # re-fetch pinned commit + re-apply overlay
./scripts/add-ftpsrv.sh        # if you still want FTP
docker compose restart web     # or re-run unraid/apply-nginx.sh
```

To move the pin, set `HOST_REF` in `.env` and refresh the overlay files so they still apply cleanly.

---

## Security notes

- The self-signed cert is only so the PS5 browser can speak TLS to **you**. Do not reuse it elsewhere.
- dnsmasq on this host becomes a DNS oracle for anyone pointed at it — keep it on a trusted LAN.
- Payloads (`*.elf`, `*.bin`) come from upstream clones / release downloads and stay in `www/` (gitignored). **Never commit them.**
- This repo deliberately contains **no** exploit sources.

## Upstream contributions

Broader firmware/UA detection and on-screen rejection text are offered upstream as:

https://github.com/arg0WAK/WAK1360-Relapse/pull/1

Deep Guide path rewrites, `<base href="/">`, `force-ready.js`, DNS, Unraid drop-ins, and ftpsrv wiring stay in this kit (server / self-host layer).
